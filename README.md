# MLOps Specialization Portfolio

Welcome to my repository showcasing my Machine Learning Engineering for Production (MLOps) Specialization Certificate! This repository is a comprehensive collection of projects, exercises, and notes that I completed while earning the MLOps Specialization offered by DeepLearning.AI.

## About the Specialization

The MLOps Specialization is a series of advanced courses aimed at equipping learners with the skills to build and maintain machine learning models in production environments. It covers a spectrum of essential topics, from designing ML systems to deploying and managing them efficiently in real-world settings.

## What's Inside

- **Projects**: In-depth projects that exhibit my proficiency in designing, implementing, and optimizing ML models for production. These projects demonstrate my skills in creating robust data pipelines, model deployment, and continuous monitoring.
  
- **Exercises**: A variety of hands-on exercises that solidified my understanding of key MLOps concepts and practices.

## Key Topics and Tools

- **End-to-End Machine Learning System Design**
- **Data Engineering and Pipeline Development**
- **Machine Learning Model Deployment**
- **Production System Monitoring and Maintenance**
- **Continuous Improvement of ML Models**

### Technologies and Tools Learned:
- **Kubernetes and Docker** for containerization and orchestration.
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** for cloud computing services.
- **TensorFlow Serving** for serving machine learning models.
- **CI/CD Pipelines** for automated model training and deployment.
- **TensorFlow Extended (TFX)** for end-to-end machine learning pipelines.
- **Monitoring Tools** like Prometheus and Grafana for performance tracking.
- **Data Validation Tools** for ensuring data quality in ML pipelines.
